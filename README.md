Telegram became one of the **top-5** downloaded apps worldwide in 2022 and now has over **700 million monthly active users**. This growth is solely from **personal recommendations** – Telegram has never paid to advertise its apps.

As Telegram keeps growing at rocket speed, many users have expressed their will to support our team. Today we're launching Premium **Telegram Premium** – a subscription that lets you support Telegram's **continued development** and gives you access to **exclusive additional features**.

This will allow us to offer all the resource-heavy features users have asked for over the years, while **preserving free** access to the most powerful messenger on the planet.

**Telegram Premium**

By subscribing to Telegram Premium, users unlock **doubled limits, 4 GB file uploads, faster downloads, exclusive stickers** and **reactions, improved chat management** – and a whole lot more.

At the same time, all **existing features** that users have come to expect and rely on for nearly a decade **remain free**. Moreover, non-premium users will be able to enjoy some of Premium's benefits: for example, download the [extra-large documents]() and view [stickers]() sent by premium users, as well as tap to increase counters on [premium reactions]() that were already added to a message.

> The contributions of premium subscribers will help improve and expand the app for decades to come, while Telegram will remain free, independent and uphold its users-first values, redefining how a tech company should operate.
